## _First project on github_

The game  called __"Field of miracles"__.

1. The program randomly selects a word from a list of words.

2. The program receives from the user the number of attempts to guess.

3. Then the program waits for the user to enter either a letter or a whole word.

- If the user writes a word, the program checks if it is the same word; if so, it informs the user that they guessed the word, or indicates that the word is incorrect.

- If the user enters a letter, the program checks if this letter is in our word, and if so, displays our word where all letters that the user has not yet guessed are replaced with "*", or "This letter is not present" otherwise.

- If the number of attempts is exhausted, the program informs the user that they lost and end the program.

P.S. Correct attempts do not count towards the counter.
